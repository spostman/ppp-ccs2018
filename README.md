# Pride and Prejudice in Progressive Web Apps: Abusing Native App-like Features in Web Applications

# Abstract
Progressive Web App (PWA) is a new generation of Web application
designed to provide native app-like browsing experiences even
when a browser is offline. PWAs make full use of new HTML5
features which include push notification, cache, and service worker
to provide short-latency and rich Web browsing experiences.
We conduct the first systematic study of the security and privacy aspects unique to PWAs. We identify security flaws in main
browsers as well as design flaws in popular third-party push services, that exacerbate the phishing risk. We introduce a new side-
channel attack that infers the victimâ€™s history of visited PWAs. The
proposed attack exploits the offline browsing feature of PWAs using
a cache. We demonstrate a cryptocurrency mining attack which
abuses service workers. Defenses and recommendations to mitigate
the identified security and privacy risks are suggested with in-depth
understanding.
